# transformer_multi_label
There are no transform neural networks that are able to perform multi label classification tasks. So I engineered one myself. 
An example for how I used this was prediciting 5 different classifications of personal identifiable information, where the 5 different classifications were financial PII, Job PII, health PII or PHI, regular personal PII, or non PII
